2. Set up a Qt project: Create a new Qt project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE), such as Qt Creator or Visual Studio with Qt integration. Set the project type to a "Qt Widgets Application."

3. Replace the default project code: Replace the default code generated by the IDE with the code provided in the previous response.

4. Build and run the project: Build and run the project using the IDE's build and run commands. The IDE will handle the compilation and execution of the code.

Make sure you have properly configured your development environment and have the necessary dependencies installed to successfully compile and run the application.
