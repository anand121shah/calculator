Yes, the code provided should run on macOS as long as you have the Qt framework properly installed and set up on your system.

Here are the general steps to compile and run a Qt application on macOS:

1. Install Qt: Download and install the Qt framework from the official Qt website (https://www.qt.io/). Choose the version suitable for macOS.

2. Open a Terminal: Launch the Terminal application on your macOS system.

3. Navigate to the project directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the C++ code file.

4. Compile the code: Execute the following command in the Terminal to compile the code:

   ```
   qmake -project
   qmake
   make
   ```

   This will generate the necessary makefiles and compile the code into an executable.

5. Run the application: After the compilation is successful, execute the following command to run the application:

   ```
   ./<executable_name>
   ```

   Replace `<executable_name>` with the name of the generated executable file.

If everything is set up correctly, the GUI calculator application should launch on your macOS system.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the code and that you have the appropriate compiler and development tools installed on your macOS system.
